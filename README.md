  <h2> Who Am I? </h2>
  <p>  A third-year computer engineering student at An-Najah National University, an optimistic Palestinian girl from Nablus with aspirations of freedom from the      occupation. Loyal to my home country and constantly striving to be a part of the changes in it, I hope that someday I can raise the name of my country highly through   my contributions, achievements in technological fields, and by helping those who are in need. In a way, I can be described as a moving fountain of hope, I am always  looking for ways to make my life better, I never lose my passion for better days and better situations, and I like to observe these details in my friends' hearts so I do my best not to leave them disappointed. Being a strong believer in Allah, the creator, I don't give up in this life because I know Allah knows exactly what I'm going through. I am made stronger by the hardships in my life. Last but not least, I would like to note that I'm too determinant in my appointments and I can work under pressure with high energy most of the time since I am constantly looking at what are the great outcomes lying beyond these challenges, which keeps me motivated. Despite all the previous details, I'm not a perfect human, Perfection is an illusion, we all have an imperfect side, for me I'm hesitant to take some decisions in certain situations, sometimes I get extremely annoyed but I somehow manage to pass through all these things smoothly. Yes, It's me Israa Odeh. </p>

   <p> <img src="Quote_Symbol.png" alt="An Image of Qoutes' Symbol" width = "20px" height = "16px">  A diligent student whom I have known from the university, she spends tremendous efforts to reach a place where she could see that her dreams and goals exist. One of them is to graduate with immense familiarity within all areas of her specialization, so she goes through terrible times of pressure to achieve her visualized results, from what I have observed, it seems that even your physical and mental health isn't as important as your studies are to you! I like how you think outside the box, by including so many areas of life in your knowledge, regardless of their direct relationship to your major. It's a pleasure to deal with you since you spread positivity so effectively and you are a cultured student. When you cross over lines, you do not blame others for your failures, but rather deal with their consequences, which makes you a unique human as well as a student. <b> (Yasmeen Sarah - Civil Engineer) </b> </p>
