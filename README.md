  <h2> Who Am I? </h2>
  <p>  A third-year computer engineering student at An-Najah National University, an optimistic Palestinian girl from Nablus with aspirations of freedom from the      occupation. Loyal to my home country and constantly striving to be a part of the changes in it, I hope that someday I can raise the name of my country highly through   my contributions, achievements in technological fields, and by helping those who are in need. In a way, I can be described as a moving fountain of hope, I am always  looking for ways to make my life better, I never lose my passion for better days and better situations, and I like to observe these details in my friends' hearts so I do my best not to leave them disappointed. Being a strong believer in Allah, the creator, I don't give up in this life because I know Allah knows exactly what I'm going through. I am made stronger by the hardships in my life. Last but not least, I would like to note that I'm too determinant in my appointments and I can work under pressure with high energy most of the time since I am constantly looking at what are the great outcomes lying beyond these challenges, which keeps me motivated. Despite all the previous details, I'm not a perfect human, Perfection is an illusion, we all have an imperfect side, for me I'm hesitant to take some decisions in certain situations, sometimes I get extremely annoyed but I somehow manage to pass through all these things smoothly. Yes, It's me Israa Odeh. </p>
