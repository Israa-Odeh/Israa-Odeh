  <h2> Who Am I? </h2>
  <p>  A third-year computer engineering student at An-Najah National University, an optimistic Palestinian girl from Nablus with aspirations of freedom from the   
    occupation. Loyal to my home country and constantly striving to be a part of the changes in it, I hope that someday I can raise the name of my country highly 
    through   my contributions, achievements in technological fields, and by helping those who are in need. In a way, I can be described as a moving fountain of 
    hope, I am always  looking for ways to make my life better, I never lose my passion for better days and better situations, and I like to observe these details 
    in my friends' hearts so I do my best not to leave them disappointed. Being a strong believer in Allah, the creator, I don't give up in this life because I know 
    Allah knows exactly what I'm going through. I am made stronger by the hardships in my life. Last but not least, I would like to note that I'm too determinant in 
    my appointments and I can work under pressure with high energy most of the time since I am constantly looking at what are the great outcomes lying beyond these 
    challenges, which keeps me motivated. Despite all the previous details, I'm not a perfect human, Perfection is an illusion, we all have an imperfect side, for 
    me I'm hesitant to take some decisions in certain situations, sometimes I get extremely annoyed but I somehow manage to pass through all these things smoothly. 
    Yes, It's me Israa Odeh. </p>

  <p> These objective feedbacks were obtained from a small group of trusted people who know me as am I in my best and worst situations.  <br> <br> <b> I have asked
    them "Who is Israa?" Can you briefly describe both the positive and negative aspects of my personality? </b> </p>

  <p> <img src="Quote_Symbol.png" alt="An Image of Qoutes' Symbol" width = "20px" height = "16px">  A diligent student whom I have known from the university, she
    spends tremendous efforts to reach a place where she could see that her dreams and goals exist. One of them is to graduate with immense familiarity within all
    areas of her specialization, so she goes through terrible times of pressure to achieve her visualized results, from what I have observed, it seems that even
    your physical and mental health isn't as important as your studies are to you! I like how you think outside the box, by including so many areas of life in your
    knowledge, regardless of their direct relationship to your major. It's a pleasure to deal with you since you spread positivity so effectively and you are a
    cultured student. When you cross over lines, you do not blame others for your failures, but rather deal with their consequences, which makes you a unique human
    as well as a student. <b> (Yasmeen Sarah - Civil Engineer) </b> </p>

    person who knows what she is doing in her life and likes to work with people in an official manner. You do not like them to become used to you, and do not get
    used to them excessively. No matter what, you will always be on the right side because you are courageous. Encouragement and motivation from others are
    invigorating and inspiring to you. You care deeply about studying, and you are very diligent in this regard since you have a goal to achieve in life, and God
    willing, you will achieve it. You love to be distinguished from others even in your attire. I like many of your qualities, but I dislike some, namely that you
    sometimes seem rushed, that you can be harsh when you get angry, that you do not have patience in some situations, and that you do not like to discuss some
    topics, even when you aren't right from others' perspectives, but never mind if you're convenient in what you are doing.

  <h2> My Goals & Vision </h2>
  <p> As life and experiences sharpen the interests and orientations of each individual, I believe these goals are representative of my current orientation in life,
    which could be changed based on my progress in my life, the experiences I pass through, and the knowledge gained in different facets of life. So perhaps as an
    undergraduate I find the following goals most attractive, but in the future, they may be completely different. </p>
